# Dependency Management Rules for Baby Podcast GenAI Project

This document outlines requirements for managing Python dependencies in this project using the uv package manager.

## Core Requirements

- Always use `uv` for package management operations, never use `pip` directly.
- Virtual environments should be managed using uv's built-in capabilities.
- Requirements files should be maintained in a clear, organized structure.

## Package Installation

- Use `uv pip install <package>` for installing individual packages.
- Always update requirements.in after adding new dependencies.
- Use `uv pip compile requirements.in` to generate/update requirements.txt.

```bash
# CORRECT
uv pip install allure-pytest

# INCORRECT
pip install allure-pytest
```

## Virtual Environment Management

- Use `uv venv` to create and manage virtual environments.
- Ensure virtual environments are properly activated before installing or updating packages.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

## Dependency Organization

- Add direct dependencies to requirements.in
- Never manually edit requirements.txt
- Group dependencies logically in requirements.in with comments
- Separate dev dependencies when appropriate

## Dependency Structure

```
# Core dependencies
package1
package2

# Development dependencies
pytest
allure-pytest

# Feature-specific dependencies
feature-package
```

## Version Pinning

- Pin specific versions for critical dependencies in requirements.in
- Otherwise, rely on uv's version resolution

```
# Pinned version example
openai==1.0.0

# Unpinned example
requests
```

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When managing dependencies, AI assistants should:

1. Always recommend and use uv commands, never pip commands.
2. Update requirements.in when suggesting new dependencies.
3. Run `uv pip compile requirements.in` after requirements.in changes.
4. When installing packages for testing only, suggest adding to dev dependencies.
5. Use `uv pip freeze` for diagnostic purposes only, not for updating requirements.txt.
6. Check for dependency conflicts before recommending new packages.
7. Ensure the virtual environment is active when running uv commands.

## Common Commands Reference

```bash
# Installing packages
uv pip install <package>

# Installing all packages from requirements.txt
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Adding a package to requirements.in and updating requirements.txt
uv pip install <package>
# Then manually add to requirements.in
uv pip compile requirements.in

# Updating all dependencies
uv pip compile --upgrade requirements.in
```
